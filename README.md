## Features

### 1. Predicting Website Structure

Understanding the structure of a website can be challenging for beginners. DevDiv assists in this process by providing tools that help users analyze and dissect the layout and organization of websites they want to clone. This can include features like outlining the HTML structure, identifying key elements, and visualizing the page's layout.
